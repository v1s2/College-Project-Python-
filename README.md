# College-Project-Python-
For our college project, we developed an encryption and decryption system using a hybrid algorithm that combines both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques. We implemented AES for fast data encryption, utilizing a randomly generated symmetric key, while employing RSA to securely transmit this key.
